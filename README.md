[MarkText](https://github.com/marktext/marktext) is a markdown editor written by [Jocs](https://github.com/Jocs) and [contributors](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/graphs/contributors).

This is a fork of [the official MarkText repository](https://github.com/marktext/marktext), where I've merged in a bunch of open PRs from the upstream repository.
My intent is to keep Marktext alive while there is a lull in engagement from the official repo's owners.
If the maintainers choose to bring that repository back to life, I'll sunset this fork in favor of theirs.

**If you are good at building things for MacOS or Windows, please reach out. I'd like to publish multiplatform builds for each release, hopefully with GitHub Actions**
